In this course we learned how to program concurrently. This means using locks, monitors and other tools to make such that when User1 modifies a value and User2 reads it,
User2 is able to read the updated value.

For the final practice of this course, we had to create a network using sockets where users would have their personal files and other users could request them.
In the following picture we can see three users, Inigo, Paula and Tin, where Tin has Fichero1.txt. Paula asks for the file through the socket and Tin sends it to her,
via the socket as well.
