This course was called Fundamentals of Algorithms. We learned different methods of coding such as using backtracking. This was done in C++. For each practice, we had to
solve an exercise and submit it in an online judge that would consider whether the solution was correct or not, as well as the runtime (if the solution took too much time it would consider it as wrong)
