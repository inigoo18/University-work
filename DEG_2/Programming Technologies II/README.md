In this course we used what we learned in Programming Technologies I to create an application that simulates traffic (as well as the contamination created etc.).
The point of interest was adding a GUI for the user rather than the console.

Each road has a certain contamination level (as it rises the face indicator on the bottom right panel changes).
Moreover, each road has traffic lights which the vehicles have to abide by.
